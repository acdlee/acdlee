### Howdy! I'm Chris

Over a decade, I've written code for multi-agent reinforcement learning for the government, computer vision for optical science research, web and desktop apps for small to mid-sized companies, and plenty more. I hold a BS in Computer Science with a Minor in Statistics from University of Maryland, College Park.

My studies and professional work was focused on craftsmanship: the correct language, efficient implementations, and idomatic programming.

I'm currently going back to school to study engineering (civil, environmental, other - haven't decided). I still program now and then, mainly in languages I find interesting.

## Current Projects
- Making my way through Alex Edward's Let's Go and Let's Go Further
- Having fun with Python
