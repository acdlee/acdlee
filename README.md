### Howdy! I'm Chris

Over a decade, I've written code for multi-agent reinforcement learning for the government, computer vision for optical science research, web and desktop apps for small to mid-sized companies, and plenty more. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a Minor in Statistics from University of Maryland, College Park.

My studies and professional work was focused on craftsmanship: the correct language, efficient implementations, and idomatic programming.

I'm currently going back to school to study mechanical engineering, and teaching aspiring developers. I still program now and then, mainly in languages I find interesting.
